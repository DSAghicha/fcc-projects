                In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a <em>'hobby' programming project that would keep
                    him occupied during the week around Christmas</em> as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a <em>new scripting language he had been thinking about lately: a descendant of
                    ABC that
                    would appeal to Unix/C hackers.</em> He attributes choosing the name <strong>"Python"</strong> to
                <em>being in a slightly irreverent mood
                    (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).</em><br> <br>He has explained that Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL, noting that ABC co-developer Lambert Meertens had <em>spent a
                    year with the SETL group at
                    NYU before coming up with the final ABC design.</em><br> <br>In July 2018, Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down from the position of BDFL of the Python programming language.
